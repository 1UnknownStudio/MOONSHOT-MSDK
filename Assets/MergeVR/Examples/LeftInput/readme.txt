DemoLeftInput

A demo of how to add MergeVR headset left trigger detection to your existing cardboard Unity project as simply as possible.

- For this demo set the 'Tap is Trigger' on the CardboardMain object to false

- Run and test on iOS or Cardboard - on a standard Cardboard device only one square will highlight at button press - with MergeVR headset you can touch left, touch right, and double touch (both buttons highlighted).
